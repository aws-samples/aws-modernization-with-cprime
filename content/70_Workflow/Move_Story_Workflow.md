To reflect that work is commencing on the first story in your sprint, let’s change the workflow status of the story to “IN PROGRESS”.

On the story details page, notice that the current value of the **Status** field is “TO DO”.  Also notice that along the top of the story details page, there is a set of buttons corresponding to the possible workflow statuses.

Click on the **In Progress** button.  This will change the **Status** field value to “IN PROGRESS”.

if you click on the **View Workflow** link, you can see the possible status values for the story and the transition rules for moving between status values.

Seeing the workflow status of each story and subtask on the details page is useful, but it’s not a great way to see an overall picture of how collectively all the stories are progressing in the sprint.  For that, we will look at the project board view.
