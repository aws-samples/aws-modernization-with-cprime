When all sub-tasks of a story are done, the story itself should be set to the “DONE” status.  You can accomplish this either from the story details page (using the workflow buttons) or from the project board by dragging the story or all its sub-tasks to the Done column.

Your team has been busy and has managed to complete the story to plant the apple tree.  Let’s move that story to “DONE” status.

On the Active Sprints view, drag both sub-tasks for the **“apple tree”** story to the **Done** column.  Jira will display a dialog asking if you want the parent story to also be moved to the “Done” status.

Click **Update** in the dialog.  You will notice that status badge for the story has been updated to “DONE”.

As you can see, the project board is a great way for everyone on your team to get an overall view of the progress of all the stories and sub-tasks in your current sprint.  As the sprint progresses, your team can collaborate on how to keep all the stories and sub-tasks moving forward.  In the next module, we’ll look at a couple more ways in which Jira can support collaboration in your team.
