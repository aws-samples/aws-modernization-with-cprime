The board view for a Jira project provides a good overview of the progress of stories in a sprint.  As a team lead, the board is an effective tool for coordinating work in your team.

Click on the **“Active sprints”** link in the left navigation area for your project.  This will show the board view for the project.

The board view consists of columns representing the workflow statuses for the project.  Within each column are “cards” for stories or sub-tasks.  For stories that have sub-tasks, the cards are for the subtasks, with the parent story spanning all the columns.  For stories that are not decomposed into sub-tasks, the card is for the story itself.

For your Courtyard Improvement project, you’ll notice that everything is currently under the “TO DO” column, though the “Gnome” story has a badge showing it is **“IN PROGRESS”**.

Cards for stories or sub-tasks that are assigned to a user will display an avatar representing the assigned user.  You can hover over the avatar to show the user’s name.

Having a unique avatar for each user on the team helps you quickly identity the user assigned to a story or sub-task on the scrum board.

### Updating Workflow via Project Board

The project board can be an excellent way to manage the workflow of your stories and sub-tasks.  As work on your sprint’s stories progresses, you’ll want to be updating the workflow status.  Let’s use the board to update the status of some sub-tasks.

Drag the **“Remove urn”** sub-task card to the **“Done”** column and drag the **“Retrieve gnome”** sub-task card to the **“In Progress”** column.  Notice that in the card for “Remove urn” the unique key for the subtask has a line through it to indicate the subtask is complete.
