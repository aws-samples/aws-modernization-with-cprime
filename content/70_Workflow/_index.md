# Workflow

Every project in Jira has a workflow consisting of a set of statuses and rules on how to transition a story between those statuses.  The workflow enables you to track and coordinate the progress of the stories as they get worked on.

For your Courtyard Improvement project, the workflow is quite simple:

In this workflow, stories and sub-tasks are in a “TO DO” status until actual work starts on them.  Once work commences, the status will be “IN PROGRESS”.  Finally, when the sub-task or story is completed, the status will be “DONE”.  Pretty simple, right?

Jira does allow you to customize the workflow for projects, however, and it’s not uncommon for a project to have half a dozen or more statuses with more complex transitions.  But for now, let’s keep things simple and stick with the basic workflow.  Your project is pretty simple and there’s no need to add complexity where it’s not needed.

Back at Mythical Misfits, your team is raring to get to work.  But how do you manage who should work on what?

In this module you will assign stories and sub-tasks to team members to work on, and you will coordinate moving a story through its workflow to track and visualize progress of work on the story.
