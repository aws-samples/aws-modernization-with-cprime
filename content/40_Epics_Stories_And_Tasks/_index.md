# Stories

Requirements for work in a project are called **“Issues”** in Jira.  Jira has numerous pre-defined issue types, and allows you to both add new issue types and customize existing types.  Each issue type serves a particular purpose in a project.  

In your project, there are five pre-defined issue types:  

- **Story** – A small unit of work that produces deliverable value to the business or customer.

- **Task**– A small unit of work that does not directly deliver value to a customer, but rather is done in support of the project, such as doing research or setting up a tool.

- **Epic** – A large requirement that needs to be broken down into stories.

- **Bug** – A problem that impairs or prevents correct project deliverables.

- **Subtask** – A work activity that is required to implement a story, task, or bug.  

These issue types have a hierarchy:

In this workshop, you will be using four issue types: epic, story, bug, and subtask.  

Stories are the primary unit of work in an Agile project.  Project execution consists of defining and implementing stories.  At any given time, a set of stories will be work in progress.  Stories not in work comprise the project backlog.

A project usually starts with a small initial set of stories, with more stories continually being added to the backlog as the business comes up with more requirements.

In this module you will create a backlog of stories for the Courtyard Improvement project for Mythical Misfits.
