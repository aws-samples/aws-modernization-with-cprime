Upon completion of a sprint—and even during a sprint—it is useful to check out reports on sprint progress.

Click on the **“Reports”** option in the left navigation panel of the project.  You may see a **“Sprint Report”** being shown.  Find the **“Switch Report”** button at the top.

Select the **“All Reports”** option in the drop-down menu.  You will see a dashboard of available reports, all of which can be valuable depending on your perspective in tracking projects. For the moment, we’ll just take a look at two reports.

### Burndown Chart

Click on the **“Burndown Chart”** selection on the page.  You will see a chart that looks something like the following.  The red lines will likely be much closer to the left side of the page since this workshop did not actually take two weeks.

The burndown chart shows the progress of completed stories during the sprint.  It shows this as a “burndown” of the story points for the sprint over time.  The actual burndown illustrated by the red line should roughly follow the gray guideline if your team progressively completed stories over the two weeks.

Viewing this chart during the course of a sprint can help you visually see how well your team is tracking to a smooth burndown, and give you an idea of how likely your team is to finish all the stories (or perhaps even finish early).  

### Velocity Chart

From the **“Switch Report”** drop-down menu at the top of the page, select **“Velocity Chart”**.

Recall from an earlier module that we discussed how you can determine how many points your team can take on in a sprint.  The velocity chart is one useful tool for answering that question.  Looking at the chart over the course of several sprints, you will get a good idea of your team’s average point completion.
