Before wrapping up the sprint, let’s make sure the status of the stories and tasks is up to date.  

Go to the **Active sprints** view of the project.  Move all of the subtasks for the “Gnome” story to the DONE column.  As before, in the **Update Parent Issue** dialog that pops up, select **Update** to set the parent story to "Done" status as well.   Leave the “plant watering” story in "TO DO" status since your team was not able to complete that story in this sprint.

At the top of the page, find the **Complete sprint** button.

Click the **Complete sprint** button.  This will bring up a dialog showing the completion status for the sprint.

The dialog shows that your team completed two stories and did not complete one story.  For the incomplete story, the dialog asks whether you should move that story back to the project backlog or move it to the next sprint.  Let’s put it back on the project backlog so your team can decide in the next sprint planning meeting whether or not it makes sense for the story to be in the next sprint.

Click **Complete**.   Jira changes the view to a Sprint Report page.  We’ll discuss that report in the next section.

But first, click **Backlog** in the left navigation to show the project backlog view.  See that the backlog has three items:  the story that did not get completed in this sprint, the story that was originally left on the backlog, and the bug that was created during the sprint.
