# Retrospective

Your team has been busy for two weeks and you have reached the end of your first sprint.  Although you have been tracking and coordinating the work of the team, it is beneficial to take a step back and see how things went.  A retrospective at the end of each sprint is a part of continuous improvement by which the team seeks to perform better in each subsequent sprint.

A retrospective is a meeting attended by the full team.  Each team member answers three questions relative to the most recent sprint:

- What went well in the sprint?  

- What did not go well in the sprint?  

- What should we do differently in the next sprint?

There are variations on the questions, but the purpose is to elicit learning that can be applied to continuously improve the effectiveness of the team.  The answers should be captured in a common location accessible by the full team.  During the retrospective meeting, It can be instructive to view the last couple of retrospectives to see if improvement is actually happening.

After the retrospective session, the sprint is considered complete.

In this module, you will close your sprint in Jira, and then take a look at some reports on how the sprint went.
