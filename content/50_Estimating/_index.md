# Story Estimation

Now that you have a backlog of stories for your project, you’re almost ready to start planning what your team should work on in the first two-week sprint.  But how do you know how many stories can your team work on and complete in that period?  To help answer that question, you’ll need an estimate of how much effort each of the stories will entail.

Story estimation can be tricky.  There are a lot of variables that can affect how much effort a story will take to implement and validate.  For this reason, it is critical that the entire team be involved in the estimation.  Product managers, developers, designers, testers, and DevOps engineers all bring a different perspective on the work required to deliver a story.
