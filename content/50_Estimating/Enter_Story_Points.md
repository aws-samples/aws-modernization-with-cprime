#### Enter Story Points in Jira

Now that you have determined the points for the first story, let’s enter the value into Jira.

On the project backlog page, click on the **“Gnome”** story in the story backlog list to show the story details on the right section of the page.  Notice that under the story summary at the top is a field called **Estimate** with a value of **“Unestimated”**.

Click on the **“Unestimated”** value, which should then change to a text field.  Enter the story point value, then click the small check mark under the field to save the value.

Once you have saved the story points value for the story, notice that the same value is reflected on the right side of the story row in the project backlog list.

Now enter the story points in Jira for the remaining stories in the backlog.  To expedite things, just enter the following story point values for the stories:

- “apple tree” story:  **2** points

- “mythical flowers” story:  **5** points  (Turns out planting mythical flowers is not so simple.)

- “plant watering” story:  **3** points

After entering the story points for the stories in Jira, your project backlog should look as follows:
