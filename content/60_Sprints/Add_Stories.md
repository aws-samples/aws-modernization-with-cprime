Recall that we determined your team can handle up to 8 points of stories in a sprint.  Looking at your project backlog, there are numerous combinations of stories that add up to a total of 8 points.  Which stories should you chose for this sprint?

Typically, a product owner will prioritize the stories in the project backlog by putting the most important stories at the top of the backlog list.  So, let’s add the top story in the backlog to the sprint.

On the project backlog page, click on the first story (“gnome” story) and drag it from the backlog list into the sprint section.

Your team now has 3 points of stories in your first sprint.  Go ahead and drag the second story (“apple tree”) into the sprint.  You’ll then have 5 points of stories in the sprint.

At this point, if you were to drag the third story (“mythical flowers”) into the sprint, there would be 10 points of stories in the sprint.  But your team can only handle up to 8 points.  So you’ll need to leave the third story for a future sprint and instead take the fourth story into this sprint.  That would result in a total of 8 points for this sprint.

In practice, there will be discussion and some negotiation in the team to determine the actual stories to take into a sprint.  This usually happens in a sprint planning meeting attended by the entire team.  In addition to determining the stories to be the next sprint, the team will also perform sub-task decomposition of the stories pulled into the sprint if that decomposition was not already done previously.

Go ahead and drag the fourth story (“plant watering”) into the sprint.  Your sprint and project backlog page should look like below.
