# Sprints

In Agile, work is performed in time intervals called “sprints”.   The time duration of a sprint is most commonly 2 weeks, but ranges from 1 to 4 weeks.

In each sprint, your team will work on and complete some number of stories.  How many stories depends on the “velocity” and “capacity” of your team.  With those two values, you can determine how many story points your team can take on in a sprint.

Determining velocity and capacity are beyond the scope of this workshop, so for now let’s assume the following:

- The sprint length for your team is 2 weeks.

- Your team is able to complete up to 8 points of stories in each sprint.
