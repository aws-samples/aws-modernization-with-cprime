On the project backlog page, find the “Create Sprint” button above the story backlog list.

Click the “Create Sprint” button.  A “Create sprint” dialog will pop up.

Let’s fill out the critical information:

- **Sprint Name** – You can keep the suggested name or change it.  It’s generally a good idea to include an ordinal in the sprint name, though, to provide some context.
- **Duration** – Change the value to “2 weeks”
- **Start Date and End Date** – Jira will autosuggest these dates based on sprint duration.  Since we intend to start the sprint today, leave the dates as suggested.

Click “Create” to create a sprint.  You should see the project backlog view page to now show a section for the newly created sprint.

With that in place, we can start adding stories to the sprint.
