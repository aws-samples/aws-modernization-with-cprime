# Projects

Jira is a tool for managing projects.  A project represents the requirements and work activities to be done by a team to produce a desired outcome,
such as developing a product or delivering a service.  A project can be closed-ended, i.e., it completes with the delivery of a specific outcome, or a project can open-ended, such as ongoing work to develop and enhance a product or provide a service.    

In this workshop, you will create a project, define the work activities for the project, and coordinate the execution of those work activities by a team.  

### Your Project for this Workshop

The project you will create and manage in this workshop is for an imaginary organization called Mythical Misfits, which provides services for abandoned mythical creatures.  The office manager for Mythical Misfits has decided that the building courtyard needs to be refurbished, and she has asked you to spearhead the project.  Don’t worry, we’ll guide you through the process.

Let’s get started!
