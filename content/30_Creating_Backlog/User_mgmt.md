## User Management Page

Before continuing to set up your project in Jira, we need to make sure all the members of your team are users in Jira as well.  Let's add them now.

To create users in Jira we need to go to "User Management" page. To do that we click on the **Cog button** on the upper right hand side of the main page,
Then select **"User Management"**.

The "User Management" page allows you to control access for existing users, create new users, and remove old unused users.
