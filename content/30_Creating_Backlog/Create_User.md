Tick the **Create Another** option at the bottom of the page, then click **Create User**.  The user will be created and the dialog will remain open for you to create a second user.   Create a second user named **Quinn**.  _(Untick the **Create Another** checkbox since we only need two users.)_

After creating the second user, you "User Management" page should look have three users as shown below.
